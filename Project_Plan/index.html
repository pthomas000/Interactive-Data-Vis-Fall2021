    <h1>Project Plan</h1>
    <h4>Abstract</h4>
        <p> <em>>Overview:</em> Narrative piece on what data privacy is, and who is affected by threats to data privacy. Which groups are most vulnerable to data privacy threats?
            <br>
            <br><em>>What the project will encompass:</em> Explanation of what is data privacy and why it’s important, and then display of which groups are most vulnerable by state (map), income and education (bar graph), and age (scatterplot). Conclusion summarizes results and circles back to the importance of data privacy.
            
            <br>
            <br></p><em>>The audience:</em> Anyone who shares their information online. </p>
            
            <br><em>>The way the project meets needs of the intended audience:</em> They are introduced to data privacy and how widespread this problem is, as well as which groups are more vulnerable than others.
