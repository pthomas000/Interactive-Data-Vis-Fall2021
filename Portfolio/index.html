    <p>
        Abstract: "Data Privacy" is a project that answers the question— "How real 
        are the threats to my data privacy?" by performing data analysis 
        and manipulation on data pulled from Pew Research 2017 Cybersecurity 
        Survey. The visualization communicate the average number of data breaches 
        per individual by variables that presented statistically significant variance 
        within the data (state, education, income, and age).

    <h2> Data</h2>
        <p>Pews Research 2017 Cybersecurity Survey data collected a variety of information 
        relating to individuals' feelings, knowledge, and experience with data privacy 
        and breaches. The data was pulled into R to determine statistically significant 
        demographic variables when accounting for variance in the number of breaches across 
        groups. State, education, income and age were statistically significant and so are
        included in this project as visualizations. Variables that were not statistically significant
        were race and political affiliation.

    <h2> Reflection</h2>
<p>
  Over the course of this semester, I’ve been developing this project in tandem with learning d3, a Javascript library for 
  manipulating documents based on data. Throughout the process I made design choices based on my data and feedback from peers, 
  which allowed me to make a lot of progress in a short amount of time; of course, there are also parts of my project that 
  could have been fleshed out a bit more given extra time— I’ve outlined some possibilities for future iterations, as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  One of the most obvious design decisions made in this project was that of color. My sketches use blue as the primary color, 
  but as I was looking at the data, and also after hearing some feedback from peers, I noticed that higher quantity visually 
  communicated in blue made one think that an increase in quantity correlated with a positive result. However, I wanted more 
  breaches to communicate increased negative experiences of individuals, so I changed the primary color to red. This allowed 
  for an increase in quantity to be understood as an increase in negative impact, as red is commonly attached to negative items, 
  like error alerts or warnings. Another color choice I made was on the breaches by age scatter plot. I previously used a green 
  to red color scale, but the green made it look like those individuals were safe, but in reality, anyone above zero was vulnerable 
  at some point to data privacy threats. To make this more clear, I switched to a pink to red color scale so it would maintain the 
  degree of threat while maintaining that all points above zero are vulnerable. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Another major design decision I made was how the data would be represented, visually. To do this, I labelled each relevant 
  variable either continuous or categorical, and then I chose the appropriate graph. The number of breaches is always continuous 
  in my data set. Age is continuous as well, so breaches by age was  represented by a scatter plot. Income could have been continuous, 
  but I wanted to compare between low, middle, and upper income class more explicitly, so I compared the average number of breaches 
  per group with income as a categorical variable; thus, a bar chart was appropriate. Race is also categorical, so I represented 
  the data in a bar chart.
  <br>
  <br>
  During the group critiques, I got helpful feedback about the wireframes of my site. Kenji pointed out that my sketch would be more 
  welcoming if I included one of the visualizations at the start of the page, rather than starting with chunks of text. As a result, 
  my second sketch breaks up the visualization section and aims to intertwine the text and visualizations in a less delineated manner. 
  I appreciated this piece of advice because it makes the overall experience of my page a lot more fun and interactive, and also makes 
  use of the visualizations in a more direct way as to how it relates to the data privacy narrative I am trying to convey. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Another helpful criticism was during the final presentation where a lot of students were confused by my scatterplot. It was unclear 
  to my peers what the data was conveying because of the vague axis titles and the improperly named graph. The title, “Which Age Groups 
  are Vulnerable?” was confusing because the circles were representing individuals, not groups. As a result, I changed the title to 
  “Average Number of Breaches per Individual by Age” which communicates the intention of the graph much more clearly. Another point 
  that was brought up was that my scatter plot was misleading because there might be individuals who overlapped, with the same age 
  and same number of breaches (which there were), and so the quantity of the individuals at a certain data point was not communicated 
  at all in the graph. To remedy this, I made the circle radius correspond to the number of individuals at that same data point, of the 
  same age and number of breaches. 
  <br>
  <br>
  My final version of the project includes probably about 65% of what was included in my sketch in terms of functionality. I was having 
  trouble getting certain interactive elements to work, like the functionality to switch between total, severe, moderate, and basic breaches. 
  If I were to share this project with the public, I would need this piece to account for the heterogeneity I observed for the variables’ 
  relation to the number of data breaches. I did not notice statistical significance for total number of data breaches between different groups
   for total number of breaches, but I did notice statistically significant variance between groups in relation to number of severe breaches. 
   Overall, my point was that no one is exempt from being vulnerable to data privacy threats, so perhaps that bit is not necessary, but I 
   think for good practice and to create a more informative and interesting data visualization experience for my audience, I would like to 
   include that bit for a future iteration. 
   <br>
   <br>
  Another bit I would change is to add a tooltip to my scatterplot. With the addition of the radius scale to account for the quantity of 
  individuals at a certain coordinate, it is unclear what that quantity is since there is no legend for the sizes of the circles (nor do 
  I think one would be helpful); it would be beneficial to have a tooltip to more clearly display the quantity of individuals at that particular 
  coordinate and also the details of age, and the total number of breaches. 
  <br>
  <br>
  My second data visualization is a revision of my project from Tutorial 2_1_quantities_and_distributions. For this revision, I removed the 
  radius scale because it was not contributing anything new to the visualization; it was only corresponding to the Ecosystem Vitality Ranking 
  which was already communicated by the x coordinate. I also removed the static country names on the graph— it was impossible to read and cluttered 
  the data making the circles difficult to see, as well. Instead, I added a tooltip that holds the country’s name, Ecosystem Vitality Ranking, 
  and Environmental Health Ranking. This is much easier to read and does not clutter the graph.
