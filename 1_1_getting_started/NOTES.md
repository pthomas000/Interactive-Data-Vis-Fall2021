## NOTES

-----------
INSTRUCTIONS:
Use this markdown file to keep track of open questions/challenges from this week's assignment.
- What did you have trouble solving?

I'm not familiar with GitHub so it took me some time to get familiar with the layout of the instructions.

I think I'm getting the hang of Terminal, but I'm not too familiar with the VS Code interface. I couldn't figure out how to properly commit a file. Although, I don't think it was included in this first tutorial, apart from Terminal. 


- What went easier than expected?

Using Terminal went better than I expected. Following the directions wasn't too difficut, apaprt from a few error messages in terms of optional content. 

- What, if anything, is currently blocking you?

Overall, it's a lot of content and commands to keep track of. I think I'll have to repeat the whole process a few times before I become comfortable with using Terminal, as well as navigating between VS Code, Terminal, and GitHub.

One particular roadblock was that I was getting error messages when I tried using the command following Local Serve Option 2.

Sometimes it helps to formulate what you understood and where you got stuck in order to move forward. Feel free to include `code snippets`, `screenshots`, and `error message text` here as well.

If you find you're not able complete this week's assignment, reflecting on where you are getting stuck here will help you get full credit for this week's tutorial
